Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) Data for 2015-16 onwards includes refugees as part of overseas migration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) Asylum Seekers are included for all years as part of overseas migration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) The difference between in and out migration may not equate to net migration for some estimates. This is due to the rounding applied to these statistics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) The International Passenger Survey (IPS) has previously been used to estimate Long Term International Migration (LTIM) at Scotland level. However, in March 2020 the IPS was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overseas migration for March to June 2020 has been modelled using alternative data sources. More information on the methodology can be found on the ONS website.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
