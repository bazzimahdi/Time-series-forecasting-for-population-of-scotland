General Details,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dataset Title:,Migration to and from Scotland,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Time Period of Dataset:,1951-52 to latest,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Geographic Coverage:,Scotland,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supplier:,National Records of Scotland (NRS),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Department:,"Population and Migration Statistics Branch, Demographic Statistics and Vital Events",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Methodology:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The migration estimates are those associated with the mid-year population estimates for 1951-52 to the most recent year available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This dataset also includes totals for in, out and net migration to and from Scotland (by origin / destination), for every year from 2001 onwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These statistics are based on moves between 01 July and 30 June of the given time period (e.g., statistics for 2019-20 are for the moves that took place between 01 July 2019 and 30 June 2020).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please refer to the methodology sections on the NRS website for more information on how population and migration estimates are produced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Population methodology can be found within the Mid Year Population Estimates section of the NRS website.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant disruption to international travel, and in turn migration flows and patterns will have been affected. In addition, some data sources have been impacted by the pandemic. Overseas migration previously used the International Passenger Survey (IPS) as the main source of data for measuring Long Term International Migration (LTIM) at Scotland level. However, in March 2020 the IPS was suspended due to the pandemic. Overseas migration for March to June 2020 has been modelled using alternative data sources. More information on the methodology can be found on the ONS website.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some commentary can be found in the Mid-Year Population Estimates for Scotland and the Registrar General’s Annual Review publications for the relevant years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data from 2001-02 on are estimates of civilian migration, and exclude movements of prisoners and armed forces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data from 1981-82 to 2000-01 also contains movements of prisoners and armed forces, so figures over that period differ from the estimates of civilian migration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asylum seekers are included in the estimates for all years. Refugees are included for 2015-16 estimates onwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Migration estimates for 2001-02 to 2010-11 were revised following the revision of mid-year population estimates for 2002 to 2010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Migration estimates for 2011-12 to 2013-14 have been corrected to take account of an age distribution error discovered for these years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In versions of the Registrar General's Annual Review prior to 2015 and Mid-year Population Estimates for Scotland prior to 2015 non-revised figures have been published for total net migration for the period 1970-71 to 1979-80. The revised total net migration figures for this period are included here. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the years 1980-81 to 2000-01 total net migration includes movements to and from the armed forces, but not changes in the numbers of armed forces and prisoners stationed in Scotland. Movements to and from the armed forces are not included in the total net migration figure for other years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The net rest of UK and net overseas migration for the period 1980-81 to 2000-01 do not add up to total net migration. This is because the components of migration were not fully revised for these years. ONS did revise Long Term International Migration (LTIM) for 1990-91 to 2000-01 but due to methodological differences between the population estimates and LTIM estimates, and the inclusion of movements to and from the armed forces in the revised total net migration, the components do not add up to the overall total net migration figures. Nevertheless, both sets of figures provide valuable information about general migration trends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
