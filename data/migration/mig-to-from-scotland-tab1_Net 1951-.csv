Note,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figures are in thousands and are for mid-year to mid-year (30 June) periods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Figures are usually revised following each census and revised figures have been included here where available. In some cases, where revised figures are not available, non-revised figures have been included because these are considered to provide valuable information about the general migration trends over the period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rest of UK and overseas migration may not add up to the total net migration figure due to differences in definitions and methodology over time and because revised components of migration were not produced for all time periods. Information about these differences can be found in the footnotes. Migration figures are also rounded to the nearest hundred, which may result in differences between the flows, net movements and total net migration figures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) In versions of the Registrar General's Annual Review prior to 2015 and Mid-year Population Estimates for Scotland prior to 2015 non-revised figures have been published for total net migration for the period 1970-71 to 1979-80. The revised total net migration figures for this period are included here. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) In the years 1980-81 to 2000-01 total net migration includes movements to and from the armed forces, but not changes in the numbers of armed forces and prisoners stationed in Scotland. Movements to and from the armed forces are not included in the total net migration figure for other years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) Rest of UK migration does not include movements to and from the armed forces or changes in the number of prisoners and armed forces in Scotland.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) Overseas migration includes asylum seekers for all years, and refugees for 2015-16 onwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5) Agreed flows between Scotland and the rest of the UK are included here from 1981-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6) Migration flows to and from overseas are available from 1991-92 following improvements to the methodology for estimating overseas migration. The figures for 1991-92 onwards are produced using a method that is mainly consistent across the UK. These figures are based on Long Term International Migration (LTIM) estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and are primarily based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). However, in March 2020 the IPS was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overseas migration for March to June 2020 has been modelled using alternative data sources. More information on the methodology can be found on the ONS website. The estimates for the years 2001-02 to 2009-10 were revised after the 2011 Census.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7) Revised figures are not available using the same method for overseas net migration for the period from 1980-81 to 1990-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8) The net rest of UK and net overseas migration for the period 1980-81 to 2000-01 do not add up to total net migration. This is because the components of migration were not fully revised for these years. ONS did revise LTIM for 1990-91 to 2000-01 but due to methodological differences between the population estimates and LTIM estimates, and the inclusion of movements to and from the armed forces in the revised total net migration, the components do not add up to the overall total net migration figures. Nevertheless, both sets of figures provide valuable information about general migration trends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
